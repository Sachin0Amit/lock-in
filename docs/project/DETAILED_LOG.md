> record; **`WORK_INVENTORY.json`** in this directory is the machine-readable
> mirror, regenerated from the live chapter data by
> `bun run scripts/build_work_inventory.ts` (numbers are never hand-typed).
> **Both are updated at every unit ship and every platform change** — they are

## 1. Project identity

| | |
|---|---|
| Project | **LockIn Library** — `github.com/Sachin0Amit/lock-in` |
| Mission | A full-stack educational platform where anyone can learn any major subject **from absolute zero to research level** through complete, professionally written digital textbooks — derivations, figures, worked examples, graded exercises; exam coverage as a by-product of understanding, never the boundary |
| Stack | Next.js 16 App Router (SSG) · TypeScript · Tailwind 4 · shadcn/ui · zustand (persist v2) · KaTeX · next-themes · framer-motion · cmdk · bun |
| Codebase | 80 tracked files under `src/`, **11,091 lines** — 2,864 reader-platform components · 5,445 shadcn/ui primitives · 2,001 content model + book data · 547 routes/pages · 234 hooks + lib |
| Authoring cadence | **One unit (chapter) of one subject at a time** — research → write → verify → ship → log; never batch-draft |

## 2. Standing rules (owner directives — never violate)

1. **One unit (chapter) of one subject at a time** (directive 2026-11-03):
   research → write → verify → ship → log, then the next unit.
2. **No daily-streak / gamified streak features, ever** — removed 2026-11-03
   by owner request; the site must never reintroduce them.
3. **Original content only** — reference books inform and verify concepts;
   protected expression is never reproduced or imitated.
4. **Storage law** — download only the current unit's references into
   `temporary-references/` (gitignored); delete working copies after the unit
   is verified; never touch Drive originals.
5. **Accuracy over volume** — no fabricated formulas, history, data or exam
   questions; exam-style items are labelled "exam-style".
6. **This log and `WORK_INVENTORY.json` are maintained at every unit ship**
   (the directive that created this file).

**Lesson 1.1 — Numbers, Digits and Place Value.** Authored with the platform
base as the pipeline-validation lesson. Opens with tally marks and the Ishango
bone; fixes the number/numeral/digit vocabulary; place value and expanded
form; zero as a placeholder (Hindu–Arabic history callout: al-Khwarizmi ~825
CE, Fibonacci's Liber Abaci 1202); the number line; international vs Indian
numeration up to 10¹¹ (crore/lakh vs million/billion); exam-relevance callout.
Accuracy pass fixed 4 issues (numeral paragraph, 10¹¹ kharab column,

**Lesson 2.1 — Addition and the Art of Carrying** (id `fm-addition-carrying`,
authored 11-03, commit `64b938c`) — **3,952 words · 17 min read · 6 terms ·
5 quiz items · 8 exercises (L1×2, L2×2, L4×2, L5×1, L6×1) · 2 original SVG
figures (number-line commutativity; carry seat-map for 4,589+2,764) · 1
derivation (the carry bound: 9+9+1 = 19, induction on columns) · 1 sum-bound
equation + 2 formula cards · 1 algorithm block (column addition) · 3 worked
examples · 1 property table · 4 callouts (warn traps, historical Gauss 5,050,
exam, insight) · sources: khattar-qa-4e, ncert-math6-ch2 · prerequisites:
lesson 1.1.** Contents: counting-on vs counting-all; the four laws of
addition (closure, commutative, associative, identity) with verified
instances; column addition algorithm and why right-alignment + units-first;
why the carry can never exceed 1 (proved); when a sum grows a new seat
(999+1); the mod-9 digit-sum checksum — with an honest blind-spot analysis
(transpositions and ±9 slips pass: 7,335 and 7,362 both fingerprint-match);
compensation (8,999+437); Gauss pairing. **Verified:** 51 arithmetic checks

**Lesson 2.2 — Subtraction and Borrowing** (id `fm-subtraction-borrowing`,
authored 11-03, hourly-run-3 ship commit) — **4,611 words · 23 min read · 6
terms · 5 quiz items · 8 exercises (L1×2, L2×2, L4×2, L5×1, L6×1) · 2
original SVG figures (number line with the 3−7 off-the-edge panel; borrow
seat-map for 4,589−2,764 with struck digits + correction digits 4→3 / 5→15
+ "1 thousand = 10 hundreds" chip) · 1 derivation (the borrow bound:
d+10 ≥ 10 > 9 ≥ bottom, why two would be absurd) · 1 seat-exchange equation
+ 2 formula cards (inverse check = total certification; digit-sum mod-9 for
subtraction) · 1 algorithm block (column subtraction, decomposition method,
zero ripple, leading-zero drop) · 2 worked examples · 1 laws-retried table
(DEAD/DEAD/DEAD/HALF with counterexamples) · 3 callouts (traps, historical
equal-additions, exam) · sources: khattar-qa-4e, ncert-math6-ch2 ·
prerequisites: lesson 2.1.** Contents: subtraction as the inverse of
addition — the missing-addend definition — plus its three faces (take-away,
missing addend, comparison); leftward hops on the number line with the
3−7 walk off the edge (closure dies; Chapter 7 preview); the four laws
retried under subtraction (closure, commutativity, associativity dead;
identity half-alive) and what each death forces onto the layout; column
subtraction by decomposition — worked 4,589−2,764 where ONE borrow undoes
2.1's THREE carries; the borrow-bound proof; the seat-exchange identity
1·10^(k+1) = 10·10^k (carrying and borrowing, opposite directions); the
1,000−1 zero-ripple dissolve as the exact mirror of 999+1; four borrowing
traps each detonated by the inverse check (reflex 2,225 → 4,989 ≠ 4,589;
no-reduce 2,825 → 5,589); checking by running addition backwards — the
inverse check is total, the digit-sum check inherits its ±9/transposition
blind spots; compensation sign-flipped (4,312−2,998 = 1,314); the
shopkeeper's counting-up route (36+200+1,500+89 = 1,825); equal-additions
vs decomposition bookkeeping (42−17 both ways = 25); the complement habit
for zero-ripple exam items (10,000−4,567 = 5,432+1); L6: the nines
complement b* = 10ⁿ−1−b with end-around carry and the negative-result
signal (2,764−4,589 → 8,174, no leading carry → −1,825). **Verified:** 63
new arithmetic checks (114 total) in `scripts/verify-unit-2.ts` ALL PASS

`fm-multiplication-repeated-addition`, authored 11-03, hourly-run-4 ship
commit) — **4,028 words · 21 min read · 6 terms · 5 quiz items · 8
exercises (L1×2, L2×2, L4×2, L5×1, L6×1) · 2 original SVG figures
(number line: 4×6 as four equal jumps vs 6×4 as six, both landing on 24;
partial-products seat map for 247×36 with shift annotation and tinted
trailing 0) · 2 derivations (partial-product carry bound ≤ 8, fixed point

binary; exam) · sources: khattar-qa-4e, ncert-math6-ch2 · prerequisites:
lesson 2.1.** Contents: multiplication as compressed addition for equal
groups; the two readings of 4×6 and the times-table symmetry they explain;
the zero property derived from distributivity (a×0 = a×0 + a×0 ⇒ 0);
column multiplication as distributivity laid out in rows — worked 247×36
= 1,482 + 7,410 = 8,892 with the shift explained as the ×10 it is; the
honest checksum section (the 2,223 misalignment product PASSES the
fingerprint because it is a genuine product of 247 — multiply the
guards); speed techniques (×9/×11 ten-routes, 198×7 = 1,386,
24×25 = 600); Russian-peasant multiplication with the binary proof
(247 = 11110111₂, kept rows sum to the product). **Verified:** 50 new

## 5. Engineering work (platform history)

### Milestones

1. **Repository initialised** (`526add7`, 11-02 14:15) — sandbox scaffold.
2. **Stack scaffolded** (`8a37a0b`, 11-02 15:09) — Next.js 16 App Router,
   TypeScript, Tailwind 4, shadcn/ui (62 primitives), Prisma schema, ESLint,
   bun. +8,239 lines.
3. **Platform base v1** (`1369d26`, 11-02 15:31) — content model with 14
   block types + honest word counter (`types.ts`); 11-discipline taxonomy;
   reader UI (home, book, lesson: KaTeX, interactive quiz, bookmark/complete,
   font scale, dark mode, zustand-persisted progress); Foundation Mathematics
   full 11-chapter TOC; lesson 1.1; 8-file project-memory system.
4. **Platform v2** (`8f1e37c`, 11-02 16:13) — SSG routes with shareable deep
   links + JSON-LD (`/`, book, lesson, revise, glossary, 404); command
   palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) with token-aware full-text search over
   books/lessons/glossary (cmdk filter off, custom scoring); reader: scrollspy
   "On this page", reading-progress bar, keyboard shortcuts (←/→, B, C),
   prerequisites chips, sources footer; quiz best-score persistence + retake;
   flashcard revision (3D flip, know/again, per-term memory, modes);
   A–Z glossary + auto formula sheet; content model v2 (prerequisites,
   sources, formula + algorithm blocks). Old client-state shell deleted.
5. **Owner directives** (`74d0f93`, 11-02 16:22) — unit-by-unit cadence
   (MASTER_PLAN §2 rewritten, §6 gates per unit); **daily streak removed**
   (header flame badge, desk pill + stat, computeStreak/dayKey helpers
   deleted; desk stat → "Terms mastered"); README "Pushing to GitHub"
   fine-grained-PAT guide. Pushed to origin/main.
6. **PAT workflow recorded** (`59b1ff9`, 11-02 16:32) — pushes use a fresh
   owner-supplied PAT, revoked after use.
7. **Website v3** (`b4f461c`, 11-02 16:52) — home: two-column hero with
   living book-shelf visual (real + ghost spines, one leaning), contextual
   CTAs (Start reading / Continue / Next), inline stat strip, compact "Your
   desk", roadmap chips; book page: breadcrumb, contextual primary button,
   TOC per-chapter counters, "Next up" highlight, quiz best-score chips;
   reader breadcrumb + two-column footer; shared `bits.tsx`
   (DISCIPLINE_ICONS + StatusBadge); `paper-dots` + `spine-label` CSS;
   dev-tools indicator disabled. VLM visual review 8–9/10 per page, dark-mode
   spine contrast fixed.
8. **Unit 1 shipped** (`a29d1b8`, 11-03 01:08) — chapter 1 complete (above) +
   Drive survey + two platform fixes shipped with the unit: mobile 390px
   horizontal overflow (implicit grid track forced max-content → base
   `grid-cols-1` on the three responsive grids) and concept-badge wrapping
   (`whitespace-nowrap` → wrap).
9. **Sandbox recycle recovered** (11-03, hourly run 2) — the platform
   re-bootstrapped the workspace (fresh scaffold git repo with no remote,
   full project intact as untracked files, dev server dead, gitignored
   artifacts wiped). Recovery: anonymous fetch from the public GitHub repo
   restored the full history (`git reset --mixed origin/main`, remote +
   upstream reconfigured); recycle's chmod noise silenced
   (`core.filemode=false` — content byte-identical); resurrected v1
   `app-shell.tsx` removed; `bun install`; dev server restarted; Drive
   survey rebuilt from embeddedfolderview (89 entries, Khattar id
   recovered); tsconfig excludes sandbox dirs; `@types/bun` added.
10. **Unit 2 opened — lesson 2.1 shipped** (11-03, hourly run 2) — see the
    chapter 2 section above; the detailed-logging pipeline ran end-to-end
    (inventory regenerated, DETAILED_LOG + WORKLOG + PROGRESS +
    RESUME_POINTER + SOURCE_LOG updated).
11. **Lesson 2.2 shipped + figure-label rule** (11-03, hourly run 3) — see
    the chapter 2 section above. Also this run: the pending lesson-2.1
    commit `64b938c` and the new ship commit were pushed with the owner's
    session PAT (one-time HTTPS push URLs; token never stored). **Defect
    found & fixed:** lesson 2.1's number-line figure rendered literal
    `$4+3$`/`$3+4$` because figure SVGs are injected raw
    (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`) — KaTeX `$…$` never runs inside SVG text;
    the page-wide KaTeX-node count had masked it. Fixed to plain labels;
    standing rule recorded (plain labels only in SVG, E2E asserts
    `dollarInSvg=0`).
12. **Lesson 2.3 shipped** (11-03, hourly run 4) — see the chapter 2
    section above. Pipeline fixes this run: 31 double-escaped apostrophes
    in the lesson edit caught by tsc (TS1005) and bulk-corrected; a
    malformed dev-generated `.next/dev/types/validator.ts` removed and
    regenerated (new standing note: delete + curl any route to fix).
    Committed locally — **not pushed** (cron rule: runs never push; the
    owner pastes a fresh PAT when they want commits released).

## 6. Research & references

### Google Drive collection (owner-supplied 2026-11-03)

Link-shared folder "books"
(`drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NI-VN0d6bUt_wciV6k0UCLN8qiqoCRO1`), works
without login. Surveyed 2026-11-03 by headless browser (virtualized grid
scrolled to exhaustion): **85 root files, ~2.9 GB, plus 4 subfolders** —
MATHS (M1–M5 JEE module PDFs: Trigonometry, Algebra, Coordinate Geometry,
Calculus, 3D Geometry), CHEMISTRY, PHYSICS, _DPPs (practice sheets). The root
reference library spans calculus, linear algebra, physics (Halliday/Resnick,
Young, Feynman, Griffiths…), chemistry (Atkins, Zumdahl, Clayden, JD Lee…),
CS (CLRS, Sedgewick, Silberschatz OS Concepts, CS:APP, Aho et al.
Compilers…), engineering (Goldstein, Mano, Sedra…), economics (Mankiw…),
humanities (Spectrum Modern India, Russell…), languages (Murphy, Genki,
Hammer's German…). Full machine listing: `temporary-references/inventory.json`
(gitignored); the complete 89-item list with sizes is committed in
`WORK_INVENTORY.json` → `research.driveCollection`.

Note: the Drive is exam/higher-ed oriented; school-level foundation topics
use the sanctioned internet fallback (NCERT-class curricula) plus the Khattar
aptitude book for exam-style coverage (MASTER_PLAN §2 step 6).

`WORK_INVENTORY.json` → `gitHistory`.

## 8. Current state & what's next

- HEAD: the hourly-run-4 ship commit (lesson 2.3 + logs/memory);
  working tree clean. origin/main is in sync **through `181f614`** (run
  3's push); run 4's ship commit and later accumulate locally until the
  owner pastes a fresh PAT (cron runs never push).
- **Sandbox recycle note:** the workspace was recycled once on 11-03 and
  fully recovered — git history restored from the public GitHub repo; the
  recovery protocol is recorded in RESUME_POINTER.json (nextAction) for any
  future recycle.
- **CURRENT (hourly cadence): lesson 2.4 — "Division, Remainders and Why
  Zero Never Divides"** next, into ch-02.ts. References: NCERT class 6
  division topics via web (sharing vs grouping, the division algorithm
  a = q·b + r, why division by zero is undefined); Khattar ch. 4
  speed-division material if applicable (BODMAS stays reserved for lesson
  2.5); verify → write → gates → log; lesson 2.5 (Order of Operations)
  completes the chapter.
- Standing side-task: EXAM_REGISTRY research (44 skeletons → 50+ researched).
