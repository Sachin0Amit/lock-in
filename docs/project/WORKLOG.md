## 2026-11-03 — Website v3: arrangement & visual overhaul

**Goal:** owner asked to change how things are arranged ("make arrangement
more good efficient and nice"). Full IA + visual pass over home, book and
chrome; reader breadcrumb aligned. No content changes.

**Home (rearranged):**
- Two-column hero: message + CTAs left, **living book-shelf visual** right
  (real cover spines for live books, ghost spines for planned shelves, one
  leaning; shelf bar + caption) on a subtle dotted-paper texture —
  visually tells "library growing one chapter at a time".
- Primary CTA is now contextual: "Start reading" (new reader) /
  "Continue — 1.1" (returning, from persisted lastLesson).
- Four stat boxes → one inline stat strip with hairline separators.
- "Your desk": lighter strip — 4 compact tiles + bookmark chips row +
  inline "Resume" link (big continue card removed; hero CTA covers it).
- Shelves: count badge ("1 live"), refined book cards (larger cover,
  StatusBadge shared component, meta strip, progress).
- "Full shelf plan" → "On the roadmap": only not-yet-live shelves, as
  compact chips (planned vs live no longer duplicated).

**Book page (rearranged):**
- Breadcrumb (Library / discipline / book) + chevron separators.
- Hero: cover + title/badges/description + compact meta strip + progress
  + actions; primary button contextual (Start chapter 1 / Next — 1.2 /
  Continue — 1.1).
- TOC: per-chapter counter chip ("1/1 done" / "5 planned"), **"Next up"**
  highlight on the first unwritten-not-completed lesson (tint + badge),
  quiz best-score chips (5/5 with award icon) on completed lessons,
  tighter rows.

**Reader:** breadcrumb now Library / book / chapter (chevrons, Library
links home). Footer (site chrome): two-column brand + quick links (home,
book, glossary, GitHub) + Ctrl-K hint; fine print contrast raised.

**Shared:** new `bits.tsx` (DISCIPLINE_ICONS + StatusBadge) — home and
book now share one source of visual truth. `paper-dots` + `spine-label`
CSS utilities. Next.js dev-tools indicator disabled (`devIndicators:
false`) — it was polluting mobile previews.

**Verified:** lint + tsc clean; all routes 200 (unknown 404); browser
E2E — hero CTAs, spine labels (6), stat strip, roadmap, footer links,
breadcrumb, "Next up" + 5/5 quiz chip + "1/1 done" counter, 54 KaTeX
nodes, C-keyboard toggle, Ctrl-K palette, flashcards; VLM visual review
rounds: home 9/10 (desktop+mobile; imbalance + ghost-contrast + devtools
overlap all fixed), book 9/10, reader 8/10 (both "cut-offs" were
viewport-fold artifacts), dark-mode spine contrast fixed; zero console
errors.

**Remaining:** awaiting Google Drive link → unit workflow (Foundation
Mathematics chapter 1, lessons 1.2+). Exam registry research. Push needs
owner (new PAT or manual).

**Git:** commit `site v3: arrangement & visual overhaul (hero shelf, contextual CTAs, TOC next-up/quiz scores, roadmap, footer)`.

## 2026-11-03 — Owner directives: unit-by-unit cadence, streak off, push access

**Directives received:** (1) content will be written **one unit of one
subject at a time** — docs changed to make the unit (chapter) the delivery
cadence; (2) the **daily streak came off the website**; (3) owner asked how
to supply a GitHub auth token — instructions added to README ("Pushing to
GitHub") and given in chat.

**Docs (unit-based workflow):**
- `MASTER_PLAN.md` §2 rewritten: "Authoring workflow — one unit of one
  subject at a time"; a unit = one chapter; research → write → verify →
  ship → log per unit; never batch-draft; storage law now "one unit at a
  time".
- §6 quality gates: run per unit, and again per book before completion.
- `BOOK_FORMAT.md`: new "Authoring cadence" section (unit = `ch-NN.ts`).
- `README.md`: status notes the cadence; new "Pushing to GitHub" section
  (fine-grained PAT: only this repo, Contents RW, 7-day expiry, revoke
  after push).
- `PROGRESS.json` + `RESUME_POINTER.json` updated (phase, rules, awaiting
  Drive link + optional PAT).

**Website (streak removal):**
- Header: flame streak badge removed; the lessons-completed badge now
  shows whenever > 0 (was previously streak-dependent).
- Home "Your desk": streak pill + "Learning streak" stat removed; fourth
  stat is now **Terms mastered** (flashcard know-count from the persisted
  store) — reads as a real study metric instead of gamification.
- `progress-store.ts`: `computeStreak`/`dayKey` helpers deleted (persisted
  shape unchanged — no migration needed).
- Policy recorded in memory: no streak/gamification features on the site.

**Verified:** lint clean; `tsc --noEmit` clean under `src/` (also fixed a
pre-existing `SearchHit` union type error — `snippet` now declared on the
book branch); browser E2E with seeded progress: home renders "Your desk"
with stats [Lessons completed 1 · Words read 2,852 · Terms mastered 3 ·
Bookmarks 0], zero occurrences of "streak" anywhere on the page, header
shows only the lessons-completed badge; lesson page renders fully (54
KaTeX nodes, quiz present, correct title); no console errors, no
hydration warnings, dev.log clean.

**Remaining:** awaiting Google Drive link → begin the unit workflow
(Foundation Mathematics, chapter 1 continuation: lessons 1.2+). Exam
registry research. Owner PAT → push local commits.

**Git:** commit `docs+ui: unit-by-unit authoring cadence, remove daily streak, push-access guide`. Pushed to `origin/main` using the owner's fine-grained PAT (README "Pushing to GitHub"); owner revokes the token afterwards — future pushes need a fresh token or an owner-side `git push`.

## 2026-11-02 — Platform v2: routed architecture + advanced study features

**Goal:** owner approved the book structure ("structure of book is ok") and asked
for improvements to it plus a more advanced website. Content authoring still
waits for the Google Drive link — no new lesson content written.

**Book structure improvements (additive, non-breaking):**
- `Lesson.prerequisites?: string[]` — rendered as completion-aware chips.
- `Lesson.sources?: string[]` — SOURCE_LOG.md citation keys, rendered at the
  lesson footer.
- New block `formula` (revision formula card → auto formula-sheet page).
- New block `algorithm` (numbered pseudocode for CS books / procedures).
- `countLessonWords` extended to both new blocks.

**Website v2:**
- Real URL routing (App Router, SSG via generateStaticParams, dynamicParams
  false): `/`, `/book/[bookId]`, `/book/[bookId]/lesson/[lessonId]`,
  `/book/[bookId]/revise`, `/book/[bookId]/glossary`, custom 404, per-page
  metadata + Book JSON-LD. Shareable deep links; browser back/forward work.
  Old client-state shell (app-shell.tsx) deleted.
- Command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K, cmdk + Dialog): full-text search across books,
  lessons AND glossary terms with snippets; quick actions (continue reading,
  random lesson, theme toggle, home); recently-written group. cmdk's internal
  filter disabled (`shouldFilter={false}`) — `searchLibrary` does token-aware
  scoring instead (fixed multi-word queries being dropped).
- Reader upgrades: scrollspy "On this page" sidebar (IntersectionObserver,
  auto heading anchors), scroll-linked reading-progress bar, keyboard
  shortcuts (←/→ lessons, B bookmark, C complete), prerequisites block,
  sources footer, shareable-path hint.
- Quiz: score summary, persisted best score per lesson (zustand persist v2),
  retake button; scoring made batch-safe via functional setState + effect.
- Flashcards (`/revise`): auto-generated deck from every `terms` block; 3D flip
  (framer-motion + CSS backface), know/again self-marking persisted per term,
  shuffle, all/not-yet-known modes, keyboard (Space/1/2), session summary.
- Glossary (`/glossary`): A–Z jump bar + entries linking to lessons; formula
  sheet from `formula` blocks (empty-state until chapters use them).
- Home "Your desk" dashboard: continue reading card with book progress,
  streak (consecutive completion days), words read, bookmarks list.
- Progress store v2: quizBest, knownTerms (+reset per book), streak helper;
  persisted shape v2, backward compatible.

**Verified:** lint clean; all routes 200 (unknown ids 404); browser E2E —
palette multi-word search + navigation, quiz answered-all → "You scored 5/5" +
quizBest persisted + retake reset, keyboard c/b, flashcards flip/mark/mode
switch (2/5 known → "3 in deck" in todo mode), scrollspy present, progress
bar, Your desk + continue card, localStorage persistence; per-page fresh loads
show zero hydration warnings; VLM screenshot review of home/lesson/book/
revise/glossary pages (only dev-tools badge + viewport cutoff noted).

**Remaining:** awaiting Google Drive link → begin subject workflow
(Mathematics first). Exam registry research. Chapters 1.2–1.11 + books 2–27.

**Git:** commit `v2: routed platform, command palette, flashcards, glossary, reader upgrades, model v2`.

## 2026-11-02 — Platform base built and verified

**Goal:** prepare the base (files, structure, memory) so book authoring can
start the moment the owner supplies the Google Drive link.

**Built:**
- Content model `src/data/library/types.ts` — Book/Chapter/Lesson + 12 block
  types (para, heading, callout×6 tones, terms, equation, derivation,
  example, figure, table, list, quiz, exercises) + honest word counter.
- Disciplines taxonomy (11 shelves) `disciplines.ts`.
- First book: **Foundation Mathematics** — full 11-chapter TOC planned;
  Chapter 1 (Numbers and Place Value) with lesson 1.1
  "Numbers, Digits and Place Value" fully authored (~2.8k words: derivation
  of positional value, place-value chart, number-line SVG figure,
  international vs Indian numeration, 5-question quiz with why-wrong
  explanations, 9 exercises across L1/L2/L4 with worked solutions,
  exam-relevance callout). Accuracy pass fixed 4 issues (numeral paragraph,
  10^11 kharab column, modular-arithmetic wording, digit-reversal formula
  999(a−d)+90(b−c) — now verified by substitution).
- Reader UI: library home (hero/stats/shelves/book cards/plan grid),
  book page (cover/TOC/progress/continue-reading), lesson reader
  (typeset typography, KaTeX, interactive quiz, collapsible solutions,
  bookmark, mark-complete, font-size control, prev/next), header search
  (Cmd+K), dark mode, warm academic palette (no blue/indigo), sticky footer.
- Progress persistence (zustand persist → localStorage, keyed by
  forever-stable lesson ids).
- Memory system: docs/project/{MASTER_PLAN, BOOK_FORMAT, PROGRESS.json,
  RESUME_POINTER.json, EXAM_REGISTRY.json, SOURCE_LOG.md,
  SUBJECT_BACKLOG.md, WORKLOG.md} + README.md.

**Verified:** lint clean; tsc clean under src/; agent-browser E2E — home
render, book TOC, lesson render (55 KaTeX nodes, 1 SVG), quiz feedback,
solution expansion, completion persistence, search, dark mode, no overflow
at 390px/1280px, no console errors.

**Remaining:** awaiting Google Drive link → begin subject workflow
(Mathematics first). Exam registry research (44 skeleton entries, all
unresearched). Chapters 1.2–1.11 + books 2–27 of mathematics.

**Git:** commit `base: platform + content model + Foundation Mathematics ch1 §1.1 + memory docs`.
